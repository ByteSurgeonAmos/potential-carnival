# TCP Client and Server with SSL Support

This project includes a TCP client and server, both with optional SSL support. The client connects to the server, sends queries, and receives responses. Both scripts are designed with robustness in mind and include comprehensive error handling.

## Features

### Server (`server.py`)

- **SSL Support**: Optionally run the server with SSL to securely communicate with clients.
- **Concurrent Connections**: Supports multiple client connections simultaneously.
- **Logging**: Provides logging for server activity and client connections.
- **Graceful Shutdown**: Handles shutdown requests and closes connections gracefully.

### Client (`client.py`)

- **SSL Support**: Optionally connect to the server securely using SSL.
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling for connection and communication errors.
- **Performance Measurement**: Measures the time taken for each query-response cycle.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ByteSurgeonAmos/potential-carnival-algoscience.git
   cd potential-carnival-algoscience
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

### Running the Server

To run the server with or without SSL support:

```bash
python server.py --server_address <server_address> --server_port <server_port> [--use_ssl]
```
````

- `--server_address`: The server's address to bind to (default: `localhost`).
- `--server_port`: The port number on which the server will listen (default: `44445`).
- `--use_ssl`: Optional flag to enable SSL for the server.

### Running the Client

To run the client and connect to a server:

```bash
python client.py --server_address <server_address> --server_port <server_port> --query "<query_string>" [--use_ssl]
```

- `--server_address`: The server's address to connect to (default: `localhost`).
- `--server_port`: The port number to connect to (default: `44445`).
- `--query`: The query string to send to the server.
- `--use_ssl`: Optional flag to enable SSL for the client connection.

## Testing

A comprehensive test suite is provided to validate both the client and server functionalities.

To run the tests, use `pytest`:

```bash
pytest tests/
```

The tests cover:

- SSL and non-SSL connections for both client and server.
- Error handling for connection, communication, and socket creation errors.
- Performance measurements and response handling for client queries.

## Error Handling

Both the client and server scripts are designed with robust error handling to manage various potential issues, such as:

- Connection failures
- SSL handshake errors
- Socket timeouts
- Invalid input data
